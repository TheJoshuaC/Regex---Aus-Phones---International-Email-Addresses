# Regex---Aus-Phones---International-Email-Addresses
Regex For Australian Phone Numbers and International Email Addresses

The Australian Phone number formats included are:
- Landlines
- Mobile Phones

There are still a few problems with it grabbing things like dates if they use formatting such as "...between the years of 1997-2020..."
and will be included in the numbers grabbed.

The modules used are:

- Requests
- BeautifulSoup
- ReGex
- CSV

Made this as my own alternative to one of the exercises from Automate the Boring Stuff by Al Sweigart
